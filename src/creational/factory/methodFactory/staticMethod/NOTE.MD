#Factory Method - The Static Creator

> *Creates a single concrete creator class from a static method*

**very much the same as the previous example**

**Advantages**: You do not need to instantiate the factory class.

**Disadvantages**: Since you can not create a subclass, you can not change the behavior of the factory class.
